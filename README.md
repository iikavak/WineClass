In this project I use the data set where i got from Kaggle. I tried to apply decision tree in this data set. I used z-score normalization , first i applied min-max normalization and used the decision tree but i got worse accuracy than z-score. When i used the z-score i got 0.909 accuracy. I used two tree one of the tree i used with entorpy. And i got better result with entorpy.
